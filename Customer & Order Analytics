#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ‘Order ID’

#2. How many of those orders were for a iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = ‘iPhone’
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ‘Order ID’

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.orders_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE LENGTH (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ‘Order ID’

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = ‘548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101’
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ‘Order ID’

#8. What products were sold in Los Angeles, and how many of each were sold?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
